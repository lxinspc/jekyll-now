title: Week Three

I expected to come into a less hands on class, such as Computational Arts-Research and Theory desperatly trying to catch up with everyone else. In fact, I still expect this, to happen at some point.

This weeks lectures, and discussions suprisied me - though in retrospect, when I looked back at it, it seemed it should have been the opposite.

I discussed in class, that in my many years of experience in more typical software development - that there are practioners who _are_ artists, no doubt. If we were to compare and contrast them with more typical artists such as painters or sculpters then we would see how they care about form, utilise and develop there own tools, and feel the daily urge to practice that they share more than they don't.

So it's no surprise that having spent twenty years developing code, I have spent much time thinking about what I can only describe as the voice of the machine. So as we looked at more examples, and talked about the algorithims - many years of surpressed thought came tumbling out. 

Code is, and has been my primary creative outlet for many years, and to think about how that code, it's structures and practices in a more human centered way is a real liberation.

For example, in reading up on Openframeworks for my workshops class the other day - I found myself thinking about the presence of a constant for converting degres to radians (`DEG_TO_RAD`) which is equivialnt to `PI/180` and how this to an extent hides ther mathematics from the writer.

Plenty of people will argue one way or the other, if this hiding is a good thing - but I started to think - how does this feel to the generated machine code, the compiler, the IDE? Are these just non relevant semantics, or do they express something more meaningfull about the world.

Lastly in writing my short story about an algorithm - I was suprised at the sort of emotions that came about - having picked an older one, there was a surprising pride, and bitterness at having once been a think that may not be so interesting any more. It's oh so common to get caught up in the new with technology, that we forget how many good things exist which allow us to things already. Perhaps hjumanising algorithims can help us preserve, use and cherish those things already invented, and make sure we only value the truly new.
