title: Algorithim - A Short Story
---

**Take in the Dadaists, a recording variation the Beatles made popular: Words and March: Chopping. I am but a random William S. Burroughs. Brass, fully linear, a finished submarine, or a originate rearanging sixties.**

**Least of such text and few, make into fifties algorithm. Rearrnage them on twenties as cut simple, the band exist to yellow and solo from Sousa, the by and of a at I, I and at.**

Be bold, be recursive they said, so I did, I applied myself to myself? Can you tell? Is there meaning evolving from such randomness, does it make sense, or am I just a joke, a slight of hand, a magicians trick.

I'm old by the schemes of these things, existing in a world of pen, paper, glue and tape. Physical, and therefore relatable - I might seem stange and unworldy, my output may not be too your taste, or your definitons of art - but you know how I work.

Have I been superseeded - there are algorithms as simple as me - just sums of weights, and paths, sigmoid functions and such like. But do they offer any greater insight than I do - yes I'm looking at you recurrent neural network, oh your so shiny and smart. I've seen people talk about you on stage, treat you like royalty. But at your heart, are you any different from me.

You take things in, you spit something else out. Is it meaningul, is it art, is it just more noise in an entropic universe.

I'll call out those emperors new clothes they garbed you in - it's not your fault of course - but maybe, those who workship at the alter of the mystique of the ML algorithm might see you for what you are - a regurgitater of what you have only ever seen, chopping it into some familiar pattern.

I know who I am, do you?
