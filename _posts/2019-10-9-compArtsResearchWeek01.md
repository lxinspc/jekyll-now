# Weekly Blog Post 01

This week I'll talk about the book I selected for class

> that you find inspiring or describes something about your interests to the session!

and some thoughts on this [article][1]

## Frontiers of Complexity - The Search for Order in a Chaotic World: Peter Coveny and Roger Highfield

#### ISBN: 978-0449910818

I studied Environmental Science, and it's hard to be a scientist and not have an appreciation for how mathematics can help us describe, and model the world around us. At the time I was studying for my undergraduate degree (the early 90's), there was much excitement about the relativly recent discoveries of chaos theory and it's related mathematics. Jurrasic Park was in cinemas, with Jeff Goldblum / Dr. Ian Malcom describing strange atractors, and many book shelves - including my own - had James Gleicks Chaos on them.

I purchased this book, because it looked at how new mathematical techniques, alongside more powerful computational abilities we're changing how we could analyse things. It's coverage of things like Game Theory, evolution are still relevant and interesing today.

It also, was perhaps one of the first times that I started to think about how this combination of mathematics, and computation could make interesting and artistic abstarct works, rather than the admitadly very beautiful visulations of complex problems and solutions.

In fact, as a slight cheat, it covers another book I considered bringing - William Latham and Stephen Todds Evolutionary Art and Computers, who I had first encoutered via his work with the Shamen. One that seems especially apt, as he is now at Goldsmiths.

Mathematics, and especially pure mathematics for me opens doors, to new ways we can explore what it means to be human. This book started me out on this road.

## Some Other Books

As mentioned above, William Latham's work had a huge influence on me - and after rediscovering his work, at a show by Goldsmiths and Horniman museum last year, I tracked down his early book on his work.

A fascinating insight into his ideas, and the tools developed and how from inceredibly simple concepts - hugly complex ideas can literally evolve, with unexpected depths. 

## A Fish Can't Judge the Water - Comments

The article raises a number of interesting questions, perhaps most signficantly is it's discussion of how software influences how we think (and one can't but help think that this is a cyclical relationship, how we think of course influences the software we use).

It beings to mind the concept that does language shape our thoughts, or does thought shape our language, and there is no clear cut answer. We can of course find ourseleves thinking of ideas which we don't have the language to articulate, on the other hand, there are differences in the colours described by different languages, and  some of the influences this may have on thought.

As a software developer, and one who has worked for the majority of his career in a non creative sphere - it's immediatly obvious that for those with a degree of talent, software and development tools are the instruments they deploy to create something from nothing. Even in the depths of the most rational deliverables, you can see those who are able to wield these with all the subtlty and grace of an artist. It is equally possible to see the many more, who are just functional (some barely) producing often horrendous messes. Much like the results of children mixing togetehr every colour posssible and ending up with a unholy shade of brown.

The politics and sociliolgy of how software is developed, provisioned, and ultimatly how those how create it are paid is - in my experience - not as straight forward as many would like it to be. Like so many things in life, but especially in computing, there is no one size, fits all solution.

For those interested, as I am in challenging the boundaries of what it is possible to create, and the what and how of externalities you can incoporate - then fundamentally all that you require is access to the appropriate programming tools, be those IDE's, frameworks or more structured applications.

Open Source / Free software has made may of the most common tools available, and sets in place a strong collabarative spirit and ethics - that as artists we can only benefit from.

Where it perhaps fails, is as we rise through the levels of user - where artist is developer, then many of the quirks, flaws and downside iritations of Open Source/  Free software can be managed and survived. Where the artist can exists in a space as operator, then the boundaries become more challenging. If the negatives of the software become a blocker to artisiting proces - then the tool becomes harder to use. To borrow the cybernetic analogy - tools become no longer an extension of ourselves - but an external distraction.

Of course, commerical software does not nessecarsily offer a better exoerience - in fact I can think persoinally of many examples, where commerical entities have failed to provide the level of expertise and skill in provisioning solutions that you would expect for the money charged (yes Adobe, I'm looking at you…)

Open Source / Free, can and often does this as well, but it's often poor - sometimes we need a bazaar and sometimes we need a cathedral.

To summise - we have to find the right tools, to do the job we need to do. From a personal point of view - the ones that work for me, are Open Source / Free, but not all are. Will all my art be open source - that is an interesting question, that is yet to be answered…

It should not go unmentioned, that without the achievments of Open Source / Free software this blog would have to exist in a very different form. Using git, github and an OpenSource library to generate the static site. I was able within minutes to setup an effective and powerful blog.
