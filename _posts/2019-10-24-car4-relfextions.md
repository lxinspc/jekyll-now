# Unerasable Characters in Machine Learning - Winnie Soon

A very interesting guest lecture, which was not only informative and interesting - but introduced a number of new topics, that whilst I had surface knowledge of, that I learnt a much about.

Winnie presented a very good, and informative summary of machine learning - and the opportunities that are available for using this for future purposes. As well as some of the challenges involved in this.

The concept of data cleansing, is an interesting one - especially coming from a formal computing background. It is a step which, like many areas of computer science, can be misrepresented, misinterprted - but also reflects something of the core nature of how we use computers.

Data cleansing, is ultimatly required, because, extraneous, or unexpected input can cause all sorts of issues in developed software. In fact much of the life of a programmer is writing code to ensure data is not entered in the first place incorrectly, or handling exceptions to expected data tio avoid issues.

On one hand, data cleansing represent the need of systems to be absolute, and have everything under consideration classified and quantified. Depending on what is being quantified, and how we personally relate to it, this could feel like an oppressive and discrimantory act - and in terms of pure definition, it is certainly is.

Without data cleansing though, there woudl be chaos - and the beaurocratic downstream effects of poor data cleansing show up in films such as Terry Gilliam's Brazil. 

The topic also arrose, that a machine learning system, can only ever be the sum of it's inputs during training. The impacts of which are well documented, and we see a lot of interesting work arising from this. To me starting to think about this, I started to think, how different is this to ourselves. Can we only ever be the product of our inputs - how original, is original thought.

We can certainyl see that ML results in brittle systems, which often fail to achieve the task they set out to do. So it's a valid criticism, and it opens up the thought about what exatctly is it about our own intellegnece that superseeds the basics methods we are using.

Lastly, on the whole topic of censorship on Weibo, whsilt I knew this was something that happened - I was surprised at the level which it went to. Winnies work, seems to be a great way of exposing things on so many levels. For me the most important things that stood out were.

* How censorship on Weibo stands out, and how by it's very nature it's something that can be tracked.
* That there is no interest (it would seem), in closing down the avenues that allow censorship to be detected - and of course, there is perhaps no desire to pretend it does not exist (which sugests an interesting personal bias to approaches to censorship)
* The resiliance, and inginuity of a population subject to censorship - it's reasuring to know that resitance always remains an option, and it made me wonder how myself, and those around me might handle a similar opportunity.

It's certainly made me more aware of the issue of censorship in China, and since then I have read a number of interesting examples. I very much look forward to seeing how Winne's work devlops and the eventual form it takes.
