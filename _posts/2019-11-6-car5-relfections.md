# Assignment Seminar

I came to this session, with quie a well developed idea - when we looked at software studies, and especially ambient interfaces. I started thinking about how early computers where represented using electro-mechnical interfaces, how these changed over time - and as computers became more complex what we lost, in our inability to fully represent the status of the machine.

Sadly, depsite adding this to three seperate areas, not much interest was shown in this area. But whislt looking I spotted that Cady had put some topics up on Generative / Narative Gaming.

This wasn't something I'd really thought about until then - but I've long had an interest in things like Speculative Fiction (or text based adventures as I knew them at the time). Both playing them, and after a week in hospital at age 10, how they are they are developed after getting the book How to Write Adevnture Games by Peter Kilworth.

Although we still have some work to do, to better flesh out exactly what we are going to look out - we generated a huge number of thoughts on ways forward, covering such ground as generting Game Boy style adventures using [GB Studio][1], how generative games currently work (such as procedularal runners), what elements might be missing, how game mechanics work for setting character and other attributes.

We've added someone to the group interested in natural language processing, and this pushes us towards thinking about how we generate text, and interaction between chracters. I'm currently intrested in some media / techno araheology looking at the history of interactive generative bots - such as Eliza, or the use of Markov chains, up to current chatbot technologies.

I'm looking forward to getting together with the group tomorrow to start fleshing these out.
