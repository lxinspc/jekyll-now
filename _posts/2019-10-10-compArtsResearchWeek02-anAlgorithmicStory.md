# A Short Story from the the POV of an Algorithm

Well, I'm trtying to write up my story, and I stumble on [this][1] whilst procrastinatingâ€¦

Looks like [this][2] should be an interesting read to help understand(?) it better

## Attempt 1

#### INPUT: `I have to write a story from the point of view of an algorithm - what do you think?`

#### OUTPUT: 

````
I have to write a story from the point of view of an algorithm - what do you think? I'll give you the code and you can fix it.


Code: I = 0 ; I = A*0.9 ; if (I <= 0) { x = f(I); } else { x = I*x + 1 ; f(I); y = f(I); } f(I);

It doesn't work, does it? I tried to do it that way and it didn't work. Let's not write this anymore.


To solve this problem, we'd simply use a list, a class that makes this stuff easy. A standard list has a single item - the first element - and a single element, the second element, which is usually the index of the first item - the second element. Now you'd write:


f(I) = 3 + 4 ; f(I) += 5


and then I'd call it. Then we would add a copy of the list to the variable A, so that we could get the value 7 again.


If that makes my life even

## Attempt 2

#### INPUT: `The Gittens-Index is`

#### OUTPUT:

````
The Gittens-Index is a directory of the cats that you've given to the Gittens Project as foster cats. It is maintained by the Gittens Project's Cat Adoption Committee.

For a non-feral cat, you should check with a rescue organization to find out if a G kitten is available. You'll also find that in some cases people want to buy G kittens. Those people probably won't be able to afford it, and they probably won't be able to find a rescue that could.

If you don't have a lot of experience getting adopted, or you have a friend who does, or you just want to try, there's an online cat registry for cats.

If you feel qualified to be an adoption officer, but don't know where to start, check out The Adoption Center's page on Feline Adoption in Atlanta. Their web site is free.

If you are a rescue cat who is willing and able to foster, you are welcomed to apply on The Feral Cat Initiative website. You can find the full list here.

## Attempt 3

#### INPUT: `Is there anybody in there`

#### OUTPUT:

````
"I don't know," the man said. "They're all gone." The two children were gone.

I asked the woman in the room if she knew what happened. She said yes, she saw the boy's body and thought he was drowned.

"What do you know about children?" I asked.

"What do you mean, 'children'? We didn't even know he'd had any children." She shook her head.

I watched with dismay as the parents went on talking, and then the woman said: "My brother was a good boy."

"A good boy?" I asked her. "What are you talking about?"

She started to explain. "We never thought anything of him," she said in a low voice. "We'd always assumed he was just a little boy who grew up in the farmhouse. But now he's gone." She shook her head and looked around the room again.

"We're all so lost."
