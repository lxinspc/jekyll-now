A lot of very interesting things in this weeks lecture to think about.

First up the Memnto Mori work by Jane Prophet was fascinating, and very interesting. There were many aspects of to this work, from taking a historical look at an existing form and updating it - to taking a research base approach to creating the content. There coulkd have been an interesting work in just updating it, to the 3D printed perojection mapped object produced - but the depth gained by adding in the neuroscience, and approaches to looking at neural activity is considerable.

I was particualry interested in the idea of feminist-technoscience looking at technology / sciene in a more whoile light - and more importantly from the inside out, and seeking ways in which improvements can be made from within. It caused me to reflect on how theire are a number of developments in phsycis and computing that have been driven in this way - by insider-outsiders who didn't fit with the mainstream, and had new ideas to bring to the field.

In particualr, the book How the Hippies saved Physics, looks at how phsycisits became dissatisifed at the direction physics, especially theoritical phjysics had taken - becming more a production line for the new expanding areas feeding the industrial miltary complex. This reaction to this sanitisation (ignorning the difficulties of uncertainty - the ability to know postion AND speed of a particle).

Simmarly, the work(s) initated through individuals such as J.C.Licklider, Bob Taylor, Alan Kay etc @ ARPA in creating ARPANET, and PARC Xeorex which changed the face of modern computing strated from the outside - and at their conception did have a different view of how the thew world could use and interact with compuyters (the concept of a computer for communication was unheard of!)

Which leads to a final point - I found KittyAI - amaxingly dystopian. I'm not sure if there was an intentionality to this, or if it is as a result of the fact that it is so muich easier for us to imagine dystopian futures, or that in current times - it's hard not to see any change as being a cover for something more dystopian.

Coming back to the point of being on the inside, I think it's easy to fall into the trap of only ever seeing downsides to technology, to see the weaknesses and issues inherent in many of the current trends. It's equally important we try to see, and root for the benefits as well - whsilt trying to change the potential downsides. The further we move away from knowing what life was like before many of the revolutions that have happened over the last decades, the easier it is to imagine a bucolic time without any downsides, that is pure fantasy.
