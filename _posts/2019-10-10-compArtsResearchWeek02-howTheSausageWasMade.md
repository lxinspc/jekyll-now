title: How the Sausage was Made
---

Having spent all week thinking about the POV of an algorithm, [stumbling on talktotransformer][1] totally changed my thoughts about what to write about.

Rather than pursue some of the algorithims I'd initially thought of - including the family of ones which look at the Explore / Exploit challenge, I remembered how cut up technique is a simple, but powerful algorithm, and how, maybe it's just a simpler version of the various nerural networks, models and algorithms. It made me think, have we really moved forwards?

So here, and look away, if as they say, you don't want to see how the sausage was made, was how I unexpectadly found myself with pen, paper and a pair os scissors.
